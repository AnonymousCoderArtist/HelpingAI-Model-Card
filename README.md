##  Powering Our Models:  Exceptional Emotional Intelligence Datasets üìö

HelpingAI's superior performance is rooted in the quality and diversity of our datasets.  We've meticulously curated and generated several large-scale datasets, each carefully designed to capture the nuances of human emotion across various contexts:

* **HelpingAI2.5-English-openemotions (4.98k):**  A large-scale, publicly available dataset for open emotions in English.
* **HelpingAI2.5-hinglish-openemotions (2.75k):** A unique dataset representing emotions expressed in Hinglish (a blend of Hindi and English), reflecting a specific cultural context.
* **EmotionalIntelligence-50K (51.8k):** A comprehensive dataset encompassing a wide range of emotions and linguistic expressions.
* **EmotionalIntelligence-10K (9.99k):**  A curated subset of EmotionalIntelligence-50K, perfect for targeted experimentation and smaller-scale model training.
* **SentimentSynth (5.3k):**  A synthetic dataset designed to augment real-world data, providing a wider spectrum of emotional expressions and preventing bias caused by limitations in real-world data collection.
* **EmotionalIntelligence-75K (75k):** Our most extensive dataset, containing 75,000 data points for comprehensive model training.
* **Med-emo (5.94k):**  A specialized dataset focusing on emotional expressions within medical contexts.
* **Bhagavad_Gita (700):**  A dataset derived from the Bhagavad Gita, exploring the emotional and philosophical depth of this classic text.
* **uncensored-vortex (8.55M):** A massive dataset designed for unfiltered and unrestricted language model training.
